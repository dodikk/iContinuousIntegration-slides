I'm not sure what the benefits are to everyone...
Could you elaborate as to why you (or anyone) would want to do this?
I'm truly curious as to the benefits, or hindrances...

Actually I just realized, the perfect solution to the problem I posted on Jan 3 is to use git submodule, it keeps things properly in sync perfectly! Far as I'm concerned this reduces the value of a static library target tremendously, 

[!!!] I don't really care to compile from source. [!!!]

So, my take on this is, as long as I can still use the Source Code approach, I'm ok with having a separate target in the project that dumps out a static library
