I am Oleksandr Dodatko from Dnipropetrovsk. I'm a software developer since 2008. I also have a master degree in computer science and machine learning. I have participated in the development of such well known projects as "Paraben's Device Seizure" and iOS versions of "Thomson Reuters Insider". I am interested in iOS TDD and continuous integration and do a bit of technical writing on them. My hobbies are volleyball and accoustic guitar.
